## ðŸ“Œ Note on Commit History

From Day 0 to Day 6, I worked consistently on the Quote Generator project. Due to breaking bugs and setup issues, I had to recreate the GitHub repository entirely on Day 7.

As a result, earlier commit history was lost â€” but the current code reflects all that work.

Daily commits are now being pushed consistently moving forward.
